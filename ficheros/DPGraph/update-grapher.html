<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">Revision history:</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>19 Dec 2016:</b> Fixed installation failure on Windows 8.1 OEM version.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>5 Sept 2013:</b> Adjusted scaling so that spheres should be spherical on
all displays.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>4 Jul 2008:</b> Added min(x,y) and max(x,y) functions.  The functions
take two values and return the minimum or maximum value.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>23 Apr 2008:</b>Put in a workaround for a bug in some keyboard drivers
which caused graphs to continue moving after the arrow keys were released.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>11 Feb 2008:</b> Fixed a problem with long file names that, under rare
circumstances, caused the DPGraph installer to halt with an error code of
C3C66941 000000CE.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>26 Jan 2008:</b> Implemented a work-around for a Windows Vista bug that
caused DPGraph to crash when using the scrollbar.  For the benefit of other
developers who might run into a similar Vista bug, the SetScrollPos function
erroneously sets the last error to Error_Call_Not_Implemented (120 decimal, 78
hexadecimal) when it returns a previous scroll position of 0 -- even if you
zero the last error by calling SetLastError before SetScrollPos.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>18 October 2004:</b> For the benefit of Derive users, DPGraph now accepts [
and ] as equivalent to ( and ).</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>22 August 2004:</b> For the benefit of Derive users, DPGraph now accepts
#e in addition to e for 2.71828..., the base of natural logarithms.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>18 November 2003:</b> DPGraph now installs under limited accounts on
Windows XP.  Added code that prevents DPGraph from crashing when buggy
memory-resident third-party programs leave floating-point interrupts
enabled.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>9 November 2001:</b> Put in a workaround for a bug in Windows XP that
caused previous versions of DPGraph to crash.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>25 September 2001:</b> The commands in DPGraph files can now extend
over more than one line.  There must be an opening parenthesis on
the first line of the command, and a closing parenthesis on the
last line.  For example, the command</font></p>
<p><code>GRAPH3D( (X^2+Y^2+Z^2=9,SIN(X)+SIN(Y)=SIN(Z)) )</code></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">can now be written as</font></p>
<p><code>GRAPH3D( (X^2+Y^2+Z^2=9,<br>
SIN(X)+SIN(Y)=SIN(Z)) )</code></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">This version also fixes some minor bugs.  You can now use
exponential notation for numbers (e.g. 1.856E3).  Also,
selecting 'By expression' on the Color menu doesn't cause crashes
when displaying parametric graphs.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>12 May 2001:</b> Added several examples to the Parametric Curves and
Surfaces directory.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>10 May 2001:</b> Fixed a bug that caused time-dependent parametric
graphs to gradually eat up memory.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>6 May 2001:</b> Added support for 2D to 5D parametric curves and surfaces
in rectangular, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates.  Also
added ceiling and floor functions.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>22 January 2001:</b> Fixed the documentation to mention both ASCII
and binary DPG files.  Added more user contributed graphs, including
a new folder called Optimal Geometry.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>2 January 2001:</b> Added support for binary DPG files, which are smaller
than ASCII DPG files.  Also released DPGraph Viewer, which can read binary DPG
files.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>12 December 2000:</b> Changed the opening screen, changed the name from
DPGraph 2000 to DPGraph, and unified the Linux and Windows versions into a
single executable file.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>26 November 2000:</b> Fixed a bug that caused some vector fields to
be displayed incorrectly when used in lists.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>7 October 2000:</b>
You can now use mathematical expressions to specify
the colors of surfaces and vectors.  This enables DPGraph to display up to
8D graphs: 3D arrays of time-dependent 3D vectors, using color to encode
another dimension of information (momentum, for example).
For example, here is what you
could type into a DPG file (by clicking on Edit inside DPGraph) to
specify the color of a surface:</font></p>
<p><code>graph3d.color := sin(x)*sin(y)*sin(z)</code></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">and here is what you could type to specify the color of vectors:</font></p>
<p><code>graph3d.vectorcolor := sin(x)*sin(y)*sin(z)</code></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">You can even make the color vary with time.  For example:</font></p>
<p><code>graph3d.color := (x+time)/6</code></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">To convert the expression to a color, DPGraph uses only the fractional
part of the expression when evaluated at the current x, y, z, and time
coordinates.  This results in values that range from 0 to 1.  These
values are then mapped onto a color wheel that ranges from red at 0,
through magenta, blue, cyan, green, yellow, and finally back to red
again at 1.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>13 August 2000:</b> Found and fixed a bug in the Linux version that
caused status information to be displayed in the middle of the main window,
instead of at the bottom of the main window.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>10 August 2000:</b> This is the release of the first Linux version.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>17 July 2000:</b> Fixed a bug under older releases of Windows 95 that
caused the OPEN and SAVE menu items to not work.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>2 May 2000:</b> Increased the maximum size of lines in DPGraph files from
1,500 characters to 36,000 characters.  In the Edit dialog box, Windows
may seem to break an extremely long line into several smaller lines each with about
1,000 characters, but internally it is still one long line.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>4 April 2000:</b> Added three new features that are handy for graphing
vector fields.  To put arrowheads on the vectors in a vector field, set
GRAPH3D.VECTORARROWHEAD := TRUE (the default is FALSE).  To change the alignment
of the vectors with respect to the points at which they are defined, set
GRAPH3D.VECTORALIGN to either CENTER or TIP (the default is TAIL).  And finally,
to view only selected vectors in a vector field, use the new NEAR function.
NEAR(X,Y,Z) is 1 if the current grid point is near (X,Y,Z), otherwise NEAR is
undefined.  To select a subset of the vectors for display, multiply NEAR(X,Y,Z)
times one of the elements of the vector.  For example, to graph the
VECTOR(2,3,1) with its tail near (0,0,0), do GRAPH3D( VECTOR( NEAR(0,0,0)*2,3,1
) ). Handy trick:  set GRAPH3D.RESOLUTION so that NEAR(X,Y,Z) is right on a grid
point.  For example, the if you are only interested in the vector NEAR(0,0,0),
set GRAPH3D.RESOLUTION := 3. Another trick:  the arguments to NEAR don't have to
be constants.  To graph a whole plane of vectors, try NEAR(X,0,0).</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>28 February 2000:</b> Fixed a bug that caused DPGraph to
occasionally freeze up.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>23 February 2000:</b> DPGraph can now graph 4D vector fields (three
spacial dimensions, plus time).  For example, to generate a 3D radial vector
field type GRAPH3D( VECTOR( X/RHO/3, Y/RHO/3, Z/RHO/3) ) into the EDIT dialog
box.  RHO is the radius in spherical coordinates.  For an example of a moving 4D
vector field that might make you seasick, try GRAPH3D(
VECTOR(-SIN(THETA+TIME)/6,COS(THETA+TIME)/6,0) ) and rotate it with the arrow
keys till you are looking at it from the top.  You might also want to set
GRAPH3D.PERSPECTIVE:=FALSE so that the columns line up and GRAPH3D.VIEW:=TOP so
that it automatically comes up in a top view.  If you have a strong stomach, you
can click on ANIMATE to continuously rotate the graph while it is seething.  You
can graph lists of vectors and you can combine vector fields with other types of
surfaces.  As with other types of surfaces, you can use the SCROLLBAR to slice
through vector fields and change the shading and highlighting.  You can also
click on COLOR to change the color of the vectors.  Click on OPEN to view
DEFAULTS.DPG, which contains an example.  DPGraph doesn't support vector
math (yet!), so you can't add or subtract vectors.  However, you can always do
the additions and subtractions inside the VECTOR function.  I've also added
hundreds of pretty pictures from the DPGraph Library and added several handy new
categories to the OPEN dialog box, including:  Factoring, Surfaces of
Revolution, Vector Fields, and Volumes of Integration.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>13 November 1999:</b> Added the ability to create implicit graphs in 2D
polar coordinates, 3D cylindrical coordinates, and 3D spherical coordinates.
The 2D polar coordinates are (R, THETA), the 3D cylindrical coordinates are (R,
THETA, Z), and the 3D spherical coordinates are (RHO, THETA, PHI).  The
Cartesian equivalents are:  R = SQRT(X^2+Y^2), THETA = ANGLE(-X,-Y)+PI, RHO =
SQRT(X^2+Y^2+Z^2), and PHI = ANGLE(Z,SQRT(X^2+Y^2)).  Added a new function
called NONNEG.  NONNEG(X) returns 1 if X>=0, otherwise it returns indefinite.
Added a "continuous rotation" mode.  To continuously rotate a graph, click on
ANIMATE, then click on CONTINUOUSLY ROTATE.  While the graph is rotating, all of
the other ways to animate graphs still work, such as slicing or using TIME as a
variable to create a movie.  For a simple example of how to use these new
features, here is how to create a movie of half of the pulsing sphere
RHO=3*SIN(TIME/4)^2 for Y>=0:  GRAPH3D( NONNEG(Y)*RHO = 3*SIN(TIME/4)^2 ), which
will continue to pulse even if you continuously rotate it.  Added a message when
you open a file asking if you want to save any changes you've made to a
previously opened file.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>27 August 1999:</b> Added two new functions that facilitate demonstrating
surfaces of revolution.  ANGLE(X,Y) returns the angle of (X,Y) with respect to
the positive X axis in the range -PI&lt;=ANGLE(X,Y)&lt;=PI.  ONE(X) returns 1 if
0&lt;=X&lt;=1, otherwise it returns indefinite.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>25 August 1999:</b> Added a SIGN function which returns -1 if the
argument is negative, 1 if the argument is positive, or indefinite if the
argument is zero or indefinite.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>22 August 1999:</b> Another minor improvement to the scrollbar.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>21 August 1999:</b> Improved the behavior of the scrollbar.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>17 August 1999:</b> Original release.</font></p>
