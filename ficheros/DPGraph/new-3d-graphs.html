<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>31 October 2000:</b> Happy Halloween from Hassan Sedaghat!
There is no sound to go along with this talking pumpkin head, but
I think that would be a fun new feature to add to DPGraph -- it's now on
my list-of-things-to-do.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>23 October 2000:</b> New and wonderful graphs from Tom Tredon!  In

of 2D and 3D vector fluid flow.  Be sure to click on Edit inside DPGraph to see
more infomation, including explanations for the settings for some of DPGraph's

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>7 October 2000:</b> You can now use mathematical expressions to specify
the colors of surfaces and vectors:  if you already have DPGraph, then get your
<a href="update-grapher.html">free update</a> here.  DPGraph can now display up to 8D
graphs:  3D arrays of time-dependent 3D vectors, using color to encode another
dimension of information (momentum, for example).  For example, here is what you
could type into a DPG file (by clicking on Edit inside DPGraph) to specify the
color of a surface:</font></p><p><code>graph3d.color :=
sin(x)*sin(y)*sin(z)</code></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">and here is what you could type to specify
the color of vectors:</font></p><p><code>graph3d.vectorcolor :=
sin(x)*sin(y)*sin(z)</code></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">You can even make the color vary with time.
For example:</font></p><p><code>graph3d.color := (x+time)/6</code></p><p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica">To convert
the expression to a color, DPGraph uses only the fractional part of the
expression when evaluated at the current x, y, z, and time coordinates.  This
results in values that range from 0 to 1. These values are then mapped onto a
color wheel that ranges from red at 0, through magenta, blue, cyan, green,
yellow, and finally back to red again at 1.</font></p>

<p><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>12 September 2000:</b> Beautiful new dynamic graph from Tom Tredon!
